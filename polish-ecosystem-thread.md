# Draft X Thread: Polish Solana Ecosystem Research

1/ Poland is quietly building serious infra on Solana. Here are 3 projects worth watching and why they matter now 🧵

2/ **Neony** — pushes exchange UX/market access forward for Solana-native users.
Why bullish: better UX compounds liquidity because fewer steps = higher participation.

3/ **Tempo** — focuses on trading experience + execution ergonomics.
Why bullish: in fast markets, execution quality *is* product quality.

4/ **Outlight AI** — AI-native product direction in Solana ecosystem context.
Why bullish: AI + on-chain primitives can create new feedback loops for discovery and automation.

5/ Why Poland specifically?
- dense technical talent
- strong crypto-native builder culture
- growing local communities that can ship globally

6/ Solana angle:
- low latency + low fees enable iterative consumer-grade product design
- easier to test, measure, and refine user behavior loops

7/ What I’d track next 90 days:
- user retention cohorts
- integration depth with core Solana rails
- evidence of repeated shipping velocity

8/ Net: Polish Solana ecosystem is underrated. The best signal isn’t hype; it’s shipping cadence + user pull.
